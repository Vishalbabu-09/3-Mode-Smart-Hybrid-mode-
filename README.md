# 🚗 3-Mode Arduino-ESP32 Smart Robot Car

A multifunctional smart robot car capable of operating in **three independent modes**: **Obstacle Avoidance**, **Line Following**, and **Bluetooth Manual Control**. The project integrates an **Arduino Uno** for real-time motor and sensor control with an **ESP32 DevKit** for wireless Bluetooth communication.

> Developed as part of the **Value Added Course (VAC) on Arduino MCU ** project by me and my teammate.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **multi-functional autonomous robot car** capable of switching between different operating modes using dedicated hardware switches.

The robot combines sensor-based automation and wireless manual control into a single platform.

The three operating modes are:

- 🚧 Obstacle Avoidance
- ➖ Line Following
- 📱 Bluetooth Manual Control

The Arduino Uno performs all real-time control operations, including motor driving, sensor processing, servo movement, and buzzer control, while the ESP32 acts as a Bluetooth communication bridge between a smartphone and the Arduino through UART serial communication.
