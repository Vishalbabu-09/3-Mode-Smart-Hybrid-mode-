# 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a multi-functional smart robot car capable of switching between three operating modes using dedicated rocker switches.

The robot combines autonomous navigation and wireless manual control into a single platform.

### Operating Modes

- 🚧 Obstacle Avoidance
- ➖ Line Following
- 📱 Bluetooth Manual Control

The **Arduino Uno** performs all real-time control operations including motor control, sensor processing, servo control, buzzer control and operating mode selection.

The **ESP32 DevKit** acts as a Bluetooth communication bridge by receiving commands from a smartphone and forwarding them to the Arduino Uno through UART serial communication.

# 🔋 Power Supply

The robot is powered using **two 3.7V 18650 Li-ion batteries connected in series**, providing approximately **7.4V**.

The battery output is distributed through the breadboard power rails and supplied directly to the **VIN** pin of both the **Arduino Uno** and the **ESP32 DevKit**.

The breadboard serves as a centralized power distribution board for the motor driver, sensors, servo motor, buzzer and other peripherals.

---

# 🎛 Operating Modes

The robot uses four rocker switches mounted on the chassis.

| Switch Position | Function |
|-----------------|----------|
| Left-most | Main Power ON/OFF |
| Second from Left | Bluetooth Manual Control |
| Middle | Obstacle Avoidance |
| Right-most | Line Following |

> **Important:** Only **one operating mode** should be enabled at a time. If two or more operating mode switches are turned ON simultaneously, the Arduino intentionally places the robot in a **STOP** state to prevent conflicting control logic and ensure safe operation.

# ⚙ Working Principle

## 🚧 Obstacle Avoidance Mode

The Arduino continuously monitors the ultrasonic sensor and center IR sensor.

When an obstacle is detected, the robot:

1. Stops and activates the buzzer.
2. Moves backward briefly.
3. Rotates the ultrasonic sensor using the servo motor.
4. Scans both directions.
5. Chooses the direction with greater clearance.
6. Turns accordingly.
7. Continues moving forward.

---

## ➖ Line Following Mode

The left and right IR sensors detect the line beneath the robot. The Arduino adjusts motor movement to keep the robot aligned with the path.

---

## 📱 Bluetooth Manual Control Mode

The ESP32 receives Bluetooth commands from a smartphone and forwards them to the Arduino through UART serial communication for movement and buzzer control.

# 📌 Sensor Configuration

| Sensor | Function |
|---------|----------|
| HC-SR04 | Obstacle distance measurement |
| SG90 Servo | Ultrasonic scanning |
| Center IR | Obstacle assistance |
| Left IR | Line detection |
| Right IR | Line detection |

---

# 📲 Bluetooth Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| F | Forward |
| B | Backward |
| L | Turn Left |
| R | Turn Right |
| S | Stop |
| H | Horn / Buzzer |
