# 🔋 Power Supply

The robot is powered using **two 3.7V 18650 Li-ion batteries connected in series**, providing an operating voltage of approximately **7.4V**.

The battery output is distributed through the breadboard power rails and supplied directly to the **VIN pin of the Arduino Uno** and the **VIN pin of the ESP32 DevKit**.

The breadboard serves as a centralized power distribution board, providing common power and ground connections to the motor driver, sensors, servo motor, buzzer, and other peripheral components.

---

# 🎛 Operating Modes

The robot features four rocker switches mounted on the chassis.

| Switch Position | Function |
|-----------------|----------|
| Left-most | Main Power ON/OFF |
| Second from Left | Bluetooth Manual Control |
| Middle | Obstacle Avoidance |
| Right-most | Line Following |

> **Important:** Only **one operating mode** should be enabled at any given time. If two or more mode switches are activated simultaneously, the Arduino intentionally places the robot in a **STOP** state to prevent conflicting control logic and ensure safe operation.

---

# ⚙ Working Principle

The robot supports **three independent operating modes**, each selected using dedicated rocker switches.

## 🚧 Obstacle Avoidance Mode

When the obstacle avoidance mode is enabled, the Arduino continuously monitors both the **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** and the **center IR sensor**.

Upon detecting an obstacle, the robot:

1. Stops and activates the buzzer.
2. Moves backward briefly.
3. Rotates the ultrasonic sensor using the SG90 servo.
4. Measures the available distance on both the left and right sides.
5. Compares both distances.
6. Turns toward the direction with greater clearance.
7. Continues moving forward.

---

## ➖ Line Following Mode

The left and right IR sensors detect the line beneath the robot.

Based on the sensor readings, the Arduino continuously adjusts the motor directions to keep the robot aligned with the track.

---

## 📱 Bluetooth Manual Control Mode

The ESP32 receives commands wirelessly from a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone.

These commands are forwarded to the Arduino Uno through UART serial communication, allowing manual control of the robot's movement and buzzer.

# 📌 Sensor Configuration

| Sensor | Function |
|---------|----------|
| HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor | Measures obstacle distance |
| SG90 Servo Motor | Rotates ultrasonic sensor for scanning |
| Center IR Sensor | Assists obstacle detection |
| Left IR Sensor | Line detection |
| Right IR Sensor | Line detection |

# 📲 Bluetooth Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| F | Move Forward |
| B | Move Backward |
| L | Turn Left |
| R | Turn Right |
| S | Stop |
| H | Activate Buzzer |

# 📍 Arduino Pin Mapping

| Arduino Pin | Connected Device |
|--------------|------------------|
| D2 | L298N IN4 |
| D4 | L298N IN3 |
| D6 | ENA & ENB (Common PWM) |
| D7 | L298N IN2 |
| D8 | L298N IN1 |
| D11 | SG90 Servo |
| D12 | Obstacle Mode Switch |
| D13 | Line Following Switch |
| A0 | Left IR Sensor |
| A1 | Center IR Sensor |
| A2 | Right IR Sensor |
| A3 | Active Buzzer |
| A4 | Ultrasonic Echo |
| A5 | Ultrasonic Trigger |

> **Note:** The ENA and ENB enable pins of the L298N motor driver are electrically connected together and controlled using Arduino digital pin **D6**. This modification was implemented due to a hardware issue with the ENB enable channel, allowing both motor channels to share the same PWM speed control signal.
